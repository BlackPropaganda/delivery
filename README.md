CS 362 (Principles of language design II) is a class full of repetitive presentations and papers on comparisons of languages like C++ and java 
and frankly there's only so many words you can say to this end.

Unlike the presentations of the past, this repo is an attempt to change
this trend. Instead of the same dead-horse-beating talking points
about what language is compiled or interpreted.

We need to Jazz this up a bit.


## Inspiration:
___

Initially, I wanted to use a remote trigger advertised by the hak5 product
'Bash Bunny' but when I attempted to use it, I figured it would be a great
way to tie all of this tech in one package, so all I needed to do is hit a
button on my flipper, then the payload would launch.

This was near impossible and the five times that I did ask for help I was
ignored. While reminding myself that I'm not a script-kiddy I gave up on the bash bunny and decided to use a new firmware application on the flipper zero, BadBluetooth.

The concept is using the bluetooth keyboard as a keyboard for HID Injection
The same attack, different medium. But the drawback is there is no integrated
storage like the bash bunny.

##  The Fix:
Just run a powershell command that launches a java and a python program that rick rolls the audience when I press a button.

Sensational.
